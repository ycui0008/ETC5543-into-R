# Introduction

`r ET("Start with motivating paragraph. Go BIG to small picture.")`


This report describes the development of the R `r ET("[ADD citation to R]")` package `ggplotIntro`, its utility and how to use the package. There are three main reasons that R is used as outlined below:

1. R is free and open-sourced; 
2. people can do basic analyses without advanced coding or programming knowledges; 
3. also the most important point, R has hundreds of packages. 

`r ET("The narrative order is not flowing well. Start with explaining what R and grammar of graphics is, why do we care about it, talk about learning ggplot, and then finally what you are aiming to do.")`

The `ggplot2` package `r ET("[ADD CITATION]")`, built on the grammar of graphics `r ET("[ADD CITATION to Wilkinson's Grammar of Graphics book]")`, is a popular package that is widely used for data visualisation. @myint2020comparison suggests that base R and `ggplot2` can make plots rated similarly on many characteristics, but "... ggplot2 graphics were generally perceived by students to be slightly more clearer overall with respect to presentation of a scientific relationship". 

`r ET("One paragraph = one idea. Below I broke up the paragraph so one is about the package, other about learning.")`

`ggplotIntro` package is mainly used for new `ggplot2` package learner. This package targets a new R learner, i.e. people who only have basic R programming knowledge. The package incorporates my own experience as a struggling R beginner with little programming knowledge. 

`r ET("This paragraph should be about learning.")`

For anyone who wants to learn programming languages, not only R, two most important characteristics are self-motivation and self-learning. Because R is open-sourced, there are many websites can teach how to learn R, such as *stackoverflow* and *RStudio Community*. For most of problems and issues, we can find answers by googling. But it is a common for most new learners -- learning programming, especially at beginning, it's boring and difficult. At beginning, people always copy and paste sample code and make minor changes to see how output changes. It takes people a while to understand how to read documentation of packages and functions. Most of university students do not have problems about self-learning, but self-motivation could be an issue. New learners need motivation, and motivation can be internal or external. The project is aiming to provide **external motivation** and to help new learners cultivate **intrinsic incentives**.


# Design of the shiny app and how to use it

`r ET("An opening paragraph to explain what is coming up is generally helpful to the reader.")`

## Gamification {#Gamification}

`r ET("What is the main idea of this paragraph? The last sentence should help you answer this question generally.")`

The `ggplotIntro` should be interesting and help new learner cultivate interests in R. Interest was recognised as an independent factor and a desired outcome in the process of learning [@schiefele1991interest]. @lepper1988motivational proposed four general ways to increase intrinsic motivation, two out of four `r ET("what does this number refer to?")` could be satisfied through gamification -- promoting students' sense of control and providing challenging activities. In the shiny app, `shinyAce` `r ET("[ADD CITATION]")` editor provide similar environment as RStudio, and the difficulty levels are increasing across sections.

`r ET("What is the importance of the second sentence below? What value does it add to the report?")`

So, before developing the shiny app, first thing was to study how to make learning progress interesting. My supervisor and I both agreed that gamifying learning progress could be a good option. Educational games have been successfully used to teach a number of school subjects [@corbett2001cognitive]. When a person receives positive feedback from learning/gaming, he/she is likely to be motivated and wants to learn/play more. The game versions of scoreboard were much more enjoyable the normal version, and were more acceptable [@flatla2011calibration] So, the project must have a score system. A pop-up window will send a congratulatory message when the user gives correct answer or send a message containing comforting words and tips on solving questions. @harrington2005s studied the reflection of students when they experiencing difficulties concluded that some students were likely to be highly task motivated, having capabilities to challenge a very competitive course. These students might be expected to have considerably better tolerance of discomfort but greater fears of failure; fear of failure may lead to increased anxiety and then to problems with tolerating these emotions [@@harrington2005s]. So, necessary comforting messages is needed. Pop-up window is also the feedback when learners submitting their answers, and the aim of pop-up windows is making people feel more ownership and purpose when engaging with tasks [@pavlus2010game]. Furthermore, the pop-up windows can fortify the feelings of interactivity because two-way communication was one factor of increasing interactivity [@@cheng2014roles] and pop-up windows is one type of two-way communication.

## Why choosing shiny app

At first, the plan was to build a package like `learnr` -- use `shiny_prerendered` Rmd file to make exercises. The advantage of this plan is good example and template already existed. The developer can do the project by following the template. But shiny app was more preferable because the project was expected to be more interactive and more like games. Gamification is very important in the project, because it is more likely that new learners that make plots through R is interesting, funny and easy (Section \@ref(Gamification)). If this project just asks people doing exercises, in conventional way, the project will be just like most online tutorials.

## Why designing in this way

### First tab in the shiny app

Figure \@ref(fig:p1) is an overview of my project. Left hand side is the list of contents, and right hand side is the content. The list of contents is in this order because I believe it is a common process when people draw plots. In other words, when people get access to a data set and want to draw plots for analysis, first thing first is understanding the data – such as, dimension, variable types, and missing values of the data. The section introduce how to use `?` to read documentation of data sets built inside the packages. And use `summary()` to have an overview of the data set. This is the basis of data analysis and very crucial because it is unlikely to draw good plots if you know nothing about the data. The section also use screenshots of `mtcars` documentation and summary as examples in first tab.

```{r p1, fig.cap="Section 1 screenshot", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot/section 1.png")
```

### Second tab in the shiny app

In second tab, the learners can play around with the code. Learners can change variables and plot types and see how the code and the plot change when they select different variables and plot types. I use `mtcars` as illustration example because it is a small data set with all numeric variables. One goal of this tab is to tell learners that it is not very hard to use `ggplot2` package to draw plots, and coding is very understandable and organised stuff `r ET("Language is too colloquial.")`. At the end of second tab, the section gives a link to `ggplot2` website. On the website, more `geom_` functions are introduced. The developer do not want to send too much contents to new learners because this shiny app is just a start point of learning R. Another goal of second tab is to show basic `ggplot2` code to learners. Knowing the basic code is enough to draw the plot. And this leads learners to third tab of the shiny app.

```{r p2, fig.cap="Section 2 screenshot", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot/section 2.png")
```

### Third tab in the shiny app

In third tab, there are three very easy questions for learners. If learners read the first two tabs, they can complete all three questions in five minutes. The screenshot below shows the tab layout. The questions are all designed as fill-in-blanks style (Figure \@ref(fig:p3)). I believe this style of questions is the most acceptable questions for new learners. There are three reasons. First, this kind of questions is easy and won’t take too much time. Because this project focuses on beginner, it is not reasonable to make it very long and hard. If exercises are long, users would bother to try them; and if exercises are hard, it would make beginners lose confidence. Second, fill-in-blank questions are easier for me to make comparison to the solution. The report will discuss this point later in the \@ref(Comparision) section . Third, fill-in-blanks questions can help new learners form a good coding style. When lines of code are extraordinarily long, good coding style and necessary comments are crucial. For writer him- or her- self, good coding style can make debug and review more easily. It is common that when we try to review our work which is done a few years or several months ago, we even don’t understand what we were doing at that time. So, good coding style and comments can help us remember. For other people who want to read the code, good coding style can make the code more readable. @spinellis2003reading mentioned “… programming usually is a team-based activity, and writing code that others can easily decipher has become a necessity.” So, good coding style can also ensure other team members to continue your works. 

```{r p3, fig.cap="Section 3 - Question 3 screenshot", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot/section 3 Q3.png")
```

After complete the question, learners can click **Submit** button to see whether they are correct (Figure \@ref(fig:p3)). If they are wrong, pop-up window will be like Figure \@ref(fig:p4). It may contain a hint message. The hint message can guide learners to solve the question. When your answer is wrong, there will be no score added in the tab.

```{r p4, fig.cap="When answer is wrong, pop-up window will be like this", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot/wrong 1.png")
```

If they are correct, the pop-up window will be like Figure \@ref(fig:p5). And when the question is correctly answered, one score will be added.

```{r p5, fig.cap="When answer is correct, pop-up window will be like this", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot/success.png")
```

Users can use the **Solution** button to see the solution to the question (Figure \@ref(fig:p6)).

```{r p6, fig.cap="Solution", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot/solution sample.png")
```

And users can click the below-the-folder button to check how many questions that they correctly answer in the section. Users will have two different pop-up dialog: upper window in Figure \@ref(fig:p7) will appear when users do not answer all questions correctly, lower window in Figure \@ref(fig:p7) will appear is when all questions are solved correctly. 

```{r p7, fig.cap="Score system will show two types of outcome", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot/tot score.png")
```


In this section, questions are made based on `diamonds` data set, because `diamonds` data set contains numeric and categorical variables. It is difficult to find a basic data set contains both types of variables. But `diamonds` has a huge disadvantage – it has `r nrow(ggplot2::diamonds)` observations. If the question used all `diamonds` observations to make plot, it would take one minute to render the plot. So, the developer uses `head()` to extract first 1000 rows in `diamonds` to reduce the time. The code chunk below is what Q2 looks like. `head()` is reasonable because the goal of the project is not analysing data but helping new learners understand and get familiar with code.


```
ggplot(data = head(diamonds,1000), aes(x = ___, y = ___)) +
    geom_point()
```

In Q3, discuss a little about the weakness of scatter plots. And after that, briefly introduce `geom_jitter()` and `geom_boxplot()`.


### Fourth tab in the shiny app

In fourth section, it introduces how to use colours and shapes in data visualisation. @stone2006choosing suggests colour can enhance and clarify a presentation. 2D plots are more understandable than 3D plots. Colour and/or shape will be additional dimension(s) in the plot. In this section, I mainly introduce **colour**. Colour is more commonly used than shape in data visualisation. People’s eyes cannot detect the differences if there are more than four types of shapes in a plot. Colour can represent categorical variables, low to high numeric values, and diverging values. Colour can also represent variables with many levels. However, how to effectively use colour in data visualisation is a big topic, I can only introduce the basis of colour in data visualisation. At the end of introduction part, `mtcars` is as example to show learners how useful colour is in data visualisation (Figure \@ref(fig:p8)).


```{r p8, fig.cap="Section 4 screenshot", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot/colourful mtcars.png")
```


After introduction of colour and shapes, there are two simple exercises. Learners can differentiate `colour` and `fill` argument in ggplot when they finish Q4 and Q5. Q4 uses `mtcars` while Q5 uses `txhousing` in Q5. Q5 introduces bar chart. There are too many plot types, thus, only those most frequently used plot types are introduced in the shiny app. Bar chart, scatter plots, box plots, violin plots, and density plots are the types of plot which are commonly used in scientific communication [@matzen2020variable]. So, `geom_point()`, `geom_boxplot()` and `geom_bar()` are all introduced in the shiny app. Q4 and Q5 tells learners that `colour` should be used in scatter plot while `fill` should be used in bar plot. If `colour` is used in Q5, the pop-up window will tell him/her `fill` should be used here (Figure \@ref(fig:p9)). 

```{r p9, fig.cap="The pop-up window for Q4", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot/wrong 2.png")
```


### Fifth tab in the shiny app

In fifth section, introduce how to make labels in graphs. In previous section, learners already understand how to make basic plots; and when a raw plot is done, plot makers should label the plot, including x- and y-axis names and units, plot title, the data source (if applicable), and legend title (if applicable). Without proper labels, plot itself will be less readable and understandable. For example, length can be measured in many different units, such as meter, inch, kilometer, etc.. And in previous section, in `mtcars`, **cyl** and **hp** are x- and y-axis, respectively. They are meaningless for readers because they have little knowledge about the data set. We must use the full name of the variables with their units to represent coordinates. So, I make one question in this section (code shown below). There is only one question because coding for labeling is easy.




```
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = cyl, y = hp)) +
  geom_point() +
  ___(___ = "Relationship between Gross horsepower and Number of Cylinders for 32 automobiles in 1974",
       ___ = "Number of Cylinders",
       ___ = "Gross horsepower")

```

### Final tab in the shiny app

The final section is harder than previous sections – it introduces Polygon. I struggle for a while because I am not sure whether I should introduce Polygon to new learners. When I learned Polygon, I thought it was difficult. But Polygon is a simple way to draw maps, and mapping is an important part in data visualisation – John Snow’s cholera map (Figure \@ref(fig:p10)) is well-known in data visualisation history. Mapping is always used in data-driven decision making process. For example, it can be used for political purpose -- mapping election results, and it was found as an efficient visualisation of election results [@ondrejka2016mapping].

```{r p10, fig.cap="John Snow{{’}}s cholera map", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot/j snow.png")
```

In this section, it introduces two steps of drawing a map (Figure \@ref(fig:p11)). First step is “get map data” and second step is “draw the map”. Here, it introduces the simplest way to get map data. And in both steps, it gives comments to help learners understand the code. 

```{r p11, fig.cap="Section 6 - Introduction", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot/section 6 intro.png")
```

The section also uses `geom_point()` to draw the map. The aim is to show why Polygon is preferable (Figure \@ref(fig:p12)).

```{r p12, fig.cap="Section 6 - comparing scatter plot to polygon", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot/section 6 scatterplot.png")
```

Next, it uses `who_covid` data set and draw map for it. `who_covid`  (Figure \@ref(fig:p13)) is a data set of `ggplotIntro` package, data wrangling part will not appear in the formal shiny app within the package. `who_covid` data is downloaded from **WHO** website.


```{r p13, fig.cap="Section 6 - who covid data set", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot/who_covid eg.png")
```


Figure \@ref(fig:p14) shows three steps of mapping. First step is to rename two countries to make two data sets can be merged. Second step is to merge `who_covid` and map data. Third step is to use `geom_polygon()` to draw the map.

```{r p14, fig.cap="Section 6 - who covid example", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot/who_covid eg2.png")
```

In this section, there are two questions – Q7 and Q8. Q7 (Figure \@ref(fig:p15)) is easy – it is almost same to the example above, except *deaths_cumulative_total* being used. Q7 is just warm up. When people first learn Polygon, they may confuse about the arguments within aes, such as, group, fill, longitude and latitude. So, it intentionally makes this simple question.



```{r p15, fig.cap="Section 6 - Q7", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot/section 6 q7.png")
```



Q8 (Figure \@ref(fig:p16)) is little bit harder than Q7, because learners must fill in all blanks. It uses a new data set here. `GDP` data is downloaded from **World Bank** website. Data wrangling could be difficult for new learners, so the developer does all data wrangling part and merge it with map data. The merged data is called `GDP_clean`. If Q8 is answered wrongfully, hint message will pop up (Figure \@ref(fig:p17)).



```{r p16, fig.cap="Section 6 - Q8", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot/section 6 q8.png")
```

```{r p17, fig.cap="Section 6 - Hints for Q8", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot/q8 hint.png")
```



### About pipe operator (`%>%`)

In early version of shiny app, the examples and questions frequently used pipe operator. In third meeting with the supervisor, she suggested that the shiny app should try to avoid using pipe operator, because it could be confusing to new learners. So, most of the code containing pipe operators were rewritten. However, in last two sections, in data wrangling part, the code would be too complex if not using pipe operators. But the data wrangling part is not the main focus of the project, and it gives enough comments in those parts by commenting after the lines of code. 

### Happen coincidence

The developer does not want learners click the **Solution** button before at least trying the exercises. The aim of **Solution** button is to give learners some hints when they feel the exercises are too hard. In fact, in the shiny app, users cannot see the solutions before clicking **Submit** button. As the screenshot below showing, the **Solution** will keep loading and show nothing (Figure \@ref(fig:p18)). The developer tried and waited for over two minutes, but it was still loading. 

```{r p18, fig.cap="Loading Solution", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot/solution loading.png")
```


After clicking **Submit** button, the solution will appear (as screenshot shown below)(Figure \@ref(fig:p19)). It may be sequential order between **Submit** and **Solution** buttons. That is, the content in **Solution** can be rendered only when users click **Submit** first.

```{r p19, fig.cap="Solution output", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot/solution output.png")
```


# Challenges

## Text display issue

The first issue was part of the text in the shiny app does not display in right way. Two screenshots depict the issue. After maximising the window of the shiny app, some paragraphs would be dislocated (Figure \@ref(fig:p20) and Figure \@ref(fig:p21)). Later, it was found the reason is the issue of the column width in the shiny app – when the shiny app contained too much text in shiny app, the text would find a way to fill the full column width.

At first, Ithe developer tried to set specific column width for each paragraph, but it did not work. Thanks for Mitch’s advice, all text part were written in Md or Rmd files, and used `includeMd` and `includeHTML` to solve the problem. The lession was it is better not to include too much text in a shiny app. Too much text will make the shiny app unnecessarily long, and it is difficult to design pretty layout in the shiny app. For instance, in the shiny app, it includes many screenshots and plots. related ui and sever must be created to show those screenshots or plots. So, the workload increases and later if there are too much plots the loading speed of the shiny app will be slow. But if using Md file or HTML file (generated by Rmd file), it would be easy to customise the layout and draw plots. In addition, because HTML files are prerendered, reading HTML files is faster than generating plots in the shiny app. Also, `includeHTML` is just one line of code, it saves spaces and shortens the length of the shiny app.

```{r p20, fig.cap="Text display - normal", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot/text issue 1.png")
```

```{r p21, fig.cap="Text display - when maximising window ", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot/text issue 1.png")
```





## Comparison to the solutions {#Comparision}

First plan was to follow the structure of `dwexercise` package. But there are big difference between *shiny-prerendered Rmd file* and *shiny app*. If using *shiny-prerendered Rmd file*, with `learnr` package, it is very easy to create code chunks letting users fill the answers. If using  shiny app, the structure will be totally different, because *shiny-prerendered Rmd file* supports users to run code while *ui* and *server* are both required in shiny app. Ui input can be problematic because some types of input would cause errors in *server* part. For instance, Figure \@ref(fig:p2) was the first-version plan -- the questions provide multiple choices to learners. The advantage of this plan is easy to construct; the disadvantage are the sense of control being reduced and limited choices could limit learners thinking. 

The second version was to let learners enter code freely. This version was similar to [`dwexercise`](https://ebsmonash.shinyapps.io/ecssc2021/#section-what-is-r), but in shiny it was more complicated. If a user wants to enter and run code in basic shiny, there are one options -- `textInput`. But if using `textInput` it would generate two more problems. One way is to let users enter full code of ggplot. The main difficulty here is how to tell the right or wrong of the code. Different coding style and space between variables and arguments can make the comparison be difficult. 

`gradethis`, `vdiffr` and `testthat` are three packages can make the comparison. `gradethis` is a package which is always used with `learnr`. It can compare learners' answers with solutions and gives messages to learners when answers are wrong. However, `gradethis` is compatible with shiny. 

```{r p22, fig.cap="gradethis package", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot/gradethis.png")
```

Next plan is to use `vdiffr` which is a `testthat` extension for monitoring the appearance of R plots. To use this package, solution plots should be saved, so later they can be used to make the comparison. Using `vdiffr` would make the package too large because of too many SVG files saved in `_snap()` folder. `testthat` is not a good option, either. It is too complicated in shiny.

Learners must enter the code in one line if using `textInput`. This is a problem if the code is too long, such as in Polygon section. The sense of control is also reduced because learners can only know whether their answers are right or wrong. They don't know which part of the answer goes wrong. So, the project will not satisfying the goals of gamification and  cultivating good coding style. Finally, `shinyAce` solved all these problems. `shinyAce` can create a code chunk which is same as the code chunk in **R studio**. It enables users to enter and run code in shiny app. Thus, even the answer is wrong, learners can see the output, which is important because there are two types of wrong answers. One is syntax error, the other is using wrong arguments or wrong variables. This is a big disadvantage when using `textInput`. Only telling students that they are wrong could result in making students remember the right answers. Merely remembering "right answer" is harmful in learning programming. The plan is to make all exercises in the shiny app are fill-in-blanks style, and `shinyAce` is the simple way to fulfill the plan. Another reason of making fill-in-blanks exercises is relatively technical. As mentioned before, different coding style and space between variables and arguments can make the comparison be difficult. The fill-in-blanks questions are easy to make the comparison. 

## Pop-up windows

In early version of the shiny app, the plan was to create an UI similar to Figure \@ref(fig:p22). After a few days, as  Section \@ref(Comparison) mentioned, `gradethis`, `vdiffr` and `testthat` were not compatible with shiny. The next version of the plan was simpler than the first one -- each question has a solution plot, and let users use eyes to compare their answers to the solution. This plan was abandoned soon because the shiny app would be interactive no longer. It also reduce the level of gamification. In this version of plan, the scoreboard would no longer exist because the comparison to the solution was done by users instead of the shiny app. 

Later, `shinyAce` and fill-in-blanks questions were determined as the final version of the questions in the shiny app. The pop-up windows are built through `showModal` and `modalDialog`. The first version of pop-up windows was simple. It only contained one-word message -- **Success** or **Wrong**. The second version differentiated the close buttons -- **Keep going** was for **Success** while **Retry** was for **Wrong**. In final version, **Hint** buttons were removed, and hint messages were merged in pop-up windows. It has **three** advantages. First, it would not show hints to learners before trying the exercises. Second, it makes the layout of the shiny app look tidier and smarter. In early version, for each question, there were three buttons: **Submit**, **Hint** and **Solution**. Learners could read the hints at any time. Now, **Hint** buttons no longer exist, and the hint messages will only available to learners when learners submit wrong answers (Figure \@ref(fig:p9)). Third, it reduces the length and complexity of the shiny script. Previously, in server part, there were 3-4 lines of code for hint message output; now, they were replaced by one line of code. In conclusion, pop-up windows increase the feeling of gamification and interaction, and also tidy the shiny script.

Chunk below shows the latest version of shiny script. The score and hint message are merged in one function.

```
    observeEvent(input$eval8, {
        if (input$Q8 == q8sol) {
            ModalTitle = "Success"
            ModalText = NULL
            ModalFooter = tagList(
                modalButton("Keep going")
            )
            score_q8 <<- 1 # Score

        } else {
            score_q8 <<- 0 # Score
            ModalTitle = "Wrong"
            ModalText = "Hint: see the solution to Q7 and previous example." # Hint message
            ModalFooter = tagList(
                modalButton("Retry")
            )
        }
        showModal(modalDialog(
            title = ModalTitle,
            ModalText,
            footer = ModalFooter
        ))
    })
```


## Modulising the shiny app through `source()`

Previously, all sections were in `app.R` file. So, the `app.R` file was extremely long. It had three weaknesses. First, it took too much time when the developer wanted to make any changes in previous section because there were hundreds lines of code in `app.R` file. Second, it was unfriendly for debugging process. The debugging would be very difficult if the developer could not locate the wrongful code section. Third, the shiny app could be hardly maintained and further developed in the future. 

Modulising the shiny app has two advantages. First, it can shorten the length of main shiny script. Second, it is convenient for developer and others adding more questions and section in the future. However, during modulisation process, every time restarting R and running the shiny app, the error messages, such as "q2sol not found", appeared. At same time, the code chunks for exercises became blank boxes. The reason was all questions were saved as rds file and sourced by the shiny app, but exercise entries and solutions were excluded. The problems was solved through sourcing the whole question script.


## Making up questions and finding data sets

In second, third and fourth sections, `mtcars` and `diamonds` data sets are used. There were two reasons of using these two data sets. First, new learners may be familiar with these two data sets because they are two commonly used data sets when people started learning R. Second, it saved time for developer. Due to the tight schedule, the developer did not have too much time for looking for new data. However, if the shiny app still used old data sets, it would be interesting no longer. But finding new data did not equal to finding a random data set. New data set must satisfy three requirements -- interesting, useful and timely. At same time, new data set must be proper for questions. Proper for questions means:

* the observations of new data set should be proper -- not too large nor too small (if too large, it would take too much loading time; if too small, questions would be too easy) ;
* the variables of new data set should be proper -- not too many nor too few (if too many, learners might spend too much time on questions; if too few, it was difficult to make questions based the data set);
* new data set should be proper for different plot types.


In conclusion, the developer needed to make trade-off between time and quality. Consequently, `ggplotIntro` package has two data sets -- `Who_covid` which was downloaded from WHO and `GDP` which was from World Bank (Both data sets are used in the shiny app). 

It is also tricky to make up questions based on the data. The questions must balance difficulty level and meaningfulness. An example about meaningless question is drawing plot of time against date. After consideration, the developer decided to keep the questions based on `mtcars` and `diamonds` because the develop wanted to make a question bank (Section \@ref(Improvement)).



## Make the shiny app as package

In [R packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/r.html), it pointed that "the first principle of making a package is that all R code goes in the `R/` directory" [@wickham2015r]. The main part of the shiny app is R script, and to transfer a shiny app to R package is put the R script of they shiny app into `R/`. Most online tutorial agrees because they are teaching how to transfer one simple shiny app script to packages. The simple shiny app refers to the shiny app contains R script only. 

For `ggplotIntro`, the situation are different. Figure \@ref(fig:p23) shows how the shiny app looks like -- in app folder, there are two folders (i.e. `questions` and `sections`), and many Rmd and html files. `questions` and `sections` folders contains modulised questions and sections R file. 

The first trial was to put everything in `R/`. An error message displayed, and the shiny app could not function at all. The reason was Rmd and html files were introduction paragraphs used in each section, which were not R code, thus, they could not be in `R/`. So, the tricky part is how to locate these files and folders.

```{r p23, fig.cap="The app folder", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot/app folder.png")
```

@wickham2015r mentioned "When a package is installed, everything in inst/ is copied into the top-level package directory. ... You are free to put anything you like in `inst/` with one caution: because `inst/` is copied into the top-level directory." Second trial was to put everything in `inst/`. An error message displayed because `launch_app()` could not launch the shiny app. Later, in the weekly meeting with developer's supervisor, the issue was found. The reason was the structure of the shiny app in `inst/` -- All contents must be in same `app/` within `inst/`. In third trial, the repo was `ggplotIntro/inst/app`. The third trial succeeded.

The shiny app used two new data sets, and the data sets were built in the package. So, some code chunks were changed (Figure (\@ref(fig:p24)) gives one example). One advantage of making such changes was to tidy the shiny app layout. Another advantage was to cut off some data wrangling code chunks. The main focus of the project is to teach ggplot, so, the learners should not be distracted from ggplot by data wrangling.


```{r p24, fig.cap="The app folder", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot/transfer to package 1.png")
```


## Some improvement {#Improvement}

At the time of writing the report, there were some improvements could and should be applied for the shiny app. First, build a question bank. The question bank has three benefits. First, give learners random question. @callender2009limited suggested students benefit a little from rereading and restudying coherent and complex learning material. If the shiny app gives same question to all learners every time, it is not beneficial for learners restudying and reusing the exercises within the shiny app. In addition, the shiny app would lose characteristics of gamification and fun soon. Promotion of long-term retention is substantial, and the learning material should allow students apply their knowledge in a variety of contexts [@ebersbach2020comparing]. Second, question bank can offer students question of different difficulty levels. One way of increasing intrinsic motivation is to give people challenging questions [@lepper1988motivational]. @alexander2013investigation also said that when playing games players enjoyed more, if the difficulty satisfied their gaming experience. Thus, it is necessary and better to offer questions of proper difficulty levels to learners. Third, the questions in shiny app will be fresh and new to learners, so that the novelty will not wear off very soon.


Second improvement is to make functions to tidy the shiny script. There are many duplicated code in the shiny script. For instance, for questions, solution part, pop-up window part, and user entry part are using similar structure of code, respectively. If similar code can be created as function, the shiny script can be tidier. Another advantage is that it is more convenient for question creation in the future.
