# My project

My project is to build a package which contains a shiny app helping new
`ggplot` learners and motivate them. The package is called `ggplotIntro`
(GitHub [link](https://github.com/ycui0008/ggplotIntro)).

# Install the package

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ycui0008/ggplotIntro")
```

# Use the package

```
launch_app()
```
